# [Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript - Anjana Vakil - JSUnconf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY) - a brief intro to functional programming
The basics:
* a paradigm, a coding style, a mindset
* treat everything as a function
* Pure function, predictable, no side effect
* Higher order function: functions are objects, can be input and output of functions
* Declarative instead of imperative: use map, forEach, reduce, instead of for loop
* immutability 
    - persistent data structures for immutability: mori, immutable.js. This is because plain immutability means copying a lot of duplicate data. These persistent data structures make use of unchanged parts, thus saves time and space. **Structrual Sharing** 
* Util libraries: lodash, ramda, underscore
