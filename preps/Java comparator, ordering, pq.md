[Java 8 doc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html)
Usage
* be passed to a sort method (such as Collections.sort or Arrays.sort) to allow precise control over the sort order
* be used to control the order of certain data structures (such as sorted sets or sorted maps)
* to provide an ordering for collections of objects that don't have a natural ordering.

For numbers, `a - b` gives the nature order, same as `a.compareTo(b)`
