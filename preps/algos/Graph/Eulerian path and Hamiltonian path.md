[Eulerian path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path#:~:text=In%20graph%20theory%2C%20an%20Eulerian,ends%20on%20the%20same%20vertex.)

In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph that visits every edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices). Similarly, an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian trail that starts and ends on the same vertex. -  Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg

Euler's Theorem:

A connected graph has an **Euler cycle** if and only if every vertex has even degree.

For the existence of **Eulerian trails** it is necessary that zero or two vertices have an odd degree

(Hamiltonian path)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path]
In the mathematical field of graph theory, a Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path in an undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle. Determining whether such paths and cycles exist in graphs is the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete.
