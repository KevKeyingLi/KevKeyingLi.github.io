title: ... in JS

"..." is an important new feature in ES6, that brings simplicity and elegance to JS. 

Briefly the ... three dots actually have two different identities in different scenarios. **Spread Syntax(Operators)** and **Rest Syntax(Parameters)**. 

As MDN described it : 
* *Spread syntax* 
 + allows an iterable such as an array expression to be **expanded** in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, 
 + or an object expression to be **expanded** in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.

* *Rest Parameters*
 * The rest parameter syntax allows us to represent an **indefinite number of arguments as an array**.

The names are selfexplanatory. ***Spread operator operates on, and expands array or object. while rest parameters represent the rest parameters in a function definition. ***

For examples of these two different scenarios, go to the MDN site which includes a good number of different ways of using ...:
