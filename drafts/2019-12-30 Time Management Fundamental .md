## 

3 principles
* space
* mind
* time

# 1 laying the Productivity Groundwork
* Recommend this course to be finished in 1 or 2 sitting. 
* schedule the time to complete it
* complete the course at your workspace, for hands-on
* when asked to do something in the video, do it as then, right away. Emphasize on taking action. 
* focus on a **lasting change**, set that as a goal. 

new tech is not key, but methodology. 
### 1.2 Understanding the focus chaos scale
This course is build to help ppl with simplified and easy rules to follow. 

### 1.3 find your personal motivation for lasting change
We need a strong motivation, ask yourself: What would you do if you had an extra 10 hours per week?

Timeless principle

# 2 Obstacle to Productivity
### 2.1 multitasking - disastrous to time management
Switch tasking is a thief

multitasking is switching tasks, and is slow...

### 2.2 consequences of multitasking/switchtasking
* time increases
* quality of work decreases when switching task
* stress level increases! 

### 2.3 Three principles of productivity
Space, Mind and Time to be more productive and focused
#### Space
**As few gathering points as possible.**

> Gathering point: a place to gather unprocessed items
> e.g. pile of paperwork, email inbox, voicemail boxes, receipts, stuff in your pocket...

#### Mind
Keep your mind clear

**Your mind is not a gathering point.**

This course will help you to get all the distractions/interruptions out of your mind. 


#### Time
Be conscious of what's important. 
create boundaries to protect attention. 

**identify your MVAs, most valuable activities, and underspend time**
and create budget to spend time on those MVAs

Underspending time, and never go over budget. 

# 3 Productivity Principle 1 Space:
## 3.1 Taking an inventory of your gathering points.

Gathering point: a place to gather **unprocessed items**
* tasks
* todos
* emails
* assignments
* ...
You haven't decide, **what** to do with it, **when** to do it, or **where** it belongs.


Average 30~40 gathering points per person, as low as 12 as high as 100. 

Target for this training: 6 or less

## 3.2 narrow your gathering points
Approved Gathering Points
Six gathering points he recomemnds: 
1. Physical Inbox: Anything physical and unprocessed should go. 
2. A portable inbox: mobile extension of you inbox. One spot in your briefcase, or one pocket in your planner. 
3. A notepad: unprocessed items and general notes. Physical/Electronic
4. One email inbox. 
5. One voicemail
6. OPTIONAL: Wild card

~My note: from his recommendation: there is no need for anything at home...~
Scratch that, he later mentioned work vs personal. 
## 3.3 Setting up an inbox gathering point.
Anything out of place/unresolved/don't have a scheduled time. 
Anything, paper, receipts, books, magzines...

Instead of putting things away when they are out of place, put things into inbox. 

And at a scheduled time, we go through that inbox, to clear things up at least once a week... discuss later. 

Let me just call it a **Week Box**, as long it can hold your stuff up to a week, it's large enough. 

## 3.4 Portable inbox
Anything we get when we are not near our inbox, we use our portable inbox as an extension. 

Just one slot in your briefcase, not the whole thing.

## 3.5 Getting the most from a notepad
A mix of non-action items/notes and actionable items. 

digital or paper

Lecturer uses Evernote to 
* gather notes
* take pictures
* record notes to self

Best practices to gather items to notepads
* clearly indicate action items. separate them from general notes by adding some symbol. e.g. an open checkbox.
* when you are in office, or near your inbox, rip off all the pages to your inbox. blank slate each day.
* if digital, move the processed items to an archive folder. 

Decide your notepad -> google keep for now. 

## Consolidate multiple email accounts
recommend one email inbox. 
if possible, processing your work and life email at one place is more efficient. 

**Handling emails in one place can help you make decisions faster and easier.**


## Consolidate multiple voicemail accounts
* Create only one place for voicemail, setup call forwarding. 
* delegate responsibility for checking voicemail. - spouse/assistance
* eliminate voicemail completely. Voicemail transcription/voice to email services.

This reduces switching between voice mail accounts. 


## Wild card
* a separate email
* text messages.
* TODO list - few ppl use this productively. Instead of checking items off your todo list by doing them, check them off, when you process them, and move the item to your calendar. 
* social networks, if needed


Processing is to decide:
* what to do with it
* when to do it
* where its home is.

## Separating work and personal gathering points.
Avoid having two gathering points **if possible**.

The more gathering points you have, the more switch you make. 

Keep gathering points down:
* reduce mistake
* reduce stress
* increase efficiency

Keep in mind: Processing is not completing tasks. 

# 4 Mind
A mind unclutered with todos, unresolved ideas, action items...

To have a system that helps with taking all the ideas that pops into one's mind and store it outside of mind.

use the approved gathering points. 

When a though come up, write a note, and toss it into inbox. 

if you find out you process some certain gathering point better then others. **Put unresolved ideas into your favorite gathering point**


## 4.2 Clearing your mind of to-dos with mental triggers
1. read through the trigger list
2. write down anything unresolved
3. continue on the list

## 4.3 set a mind clearing schedule
**Set up a time every 3 month/quarter to clear up tasks in mind.**

Everytime go through the mental trigger list just like first time. 

## 4.4 taking the next step to keeping your mind clear

What to do with the todo list will come in following chapters. 

**Cultivate the habit of clearing your mind *immediately***

Your mind is not an acceptable gathering point. 

# 5 Time
## Choosing the right calendar for you
paper vs digital

### Paper planner
a weekly planner that shows the hours

Limitations:
* recurring appointments
* bulky
* loss/damage

### Digital Calendar
* fast
* accessible
* portable

Don't skimp, choose the best

Best if you just use one calendar, that could sync. So much less attention switching. 

## Effective Calendar Usage

1. Think of your calendar as you **time budget**. Time debt takes interests -> switching cost. *Schedule almost everything*. 
2. Avoid double booking. Never attempt multi-task
3. Add appointments immediately. Never commit to an appointment until putting it into your calendar. 
4. Scedule buffer/travel time for appointments
5. Think of your calendar as a commitment to others and yourself. 
6. Think long term. Be comfortable to schedule into the future. 

Procrastination can be a positive thing if you're using a schedule and are committed to following that schedule. In fact, shifting from a "now" mindset to a "when" mindset will reduce a lot of switching cost in your day.

## Say no to others.

Say no more often than you say yes. Tactically and gracefully. 

1. ask for requests via email. 
2. When say "yes", ask when.
3. if not now, when? 

## say no to yourself
1. create a perhaps list. Ideas that are not commited, have no immediate impact, and but you are interested. 

Review the list every 1~3 month. 


2. When? ask yourself when you will be able to do it. 

Do I need to do this now, or can I do it later. 

Don't think in terms of days/weeks. Think of in months, years...

Ask when is the latest I can complete this? -> focus on current tasks, and not distracted by other ideas. 


# 6 Eqquipping yourself for action
