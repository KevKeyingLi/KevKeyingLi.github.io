<p>Intention helps us get clear on what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve, and gives us a better chance of creating the habit of a regular practice. </p>
<h3 id="12-basic-body-science"><a name="user-content-12-basic-body-science" href="#12-basic-body-science" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>1.2 Basic body science</h3>
<p>We have two nervous systems in our bodies,<br />
<em> the sympathetic, known as fight or flight<br />
    - Our pupils dilate so we can see better in the dark.<br />
    - Our blood gets stickier so that if we&rsquo;re injured, we won&rsquo;t bleed to death.<br />
    - Our lungs and muscles get more oxygen, and our bodies are flooded with the stress hormones <strong>cortisol</strong> and adrenaline.<br />
</em> the parasympathetic system, known as rest and digest.<br />
    - opposite of fight or flight. Our muscles relax, the cortisol and adrenaline start to flush from our bodies, and the cognitive parts of our brains turn back on.</p>
<p>Stress, over time, can lead to serious health issues. <br />
When we&rsquo;re carrying so many stress hormones, like <strong>cortisol</strong>, for so long, it can lead to memory loss, serious health problems, even the shrinking of the cognitive parts of our brains. The good news is we know how to hack the system.</p>
<p>One option that&rsquo;s always available to us is our breath. Just taking a few conscious, deep breaths starts to activate the parasympathetic system, and this helps break up some of the mental spinning we often get caught in, and our bodies start to relax</p>
<h3 id="13-posture"><a name="user-content-13-posture" href="#13-posture" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>1.3 Posture</h3>
<p>it&rsquo;s helpful to be seated when meditating. We find a <strong>comfortable, yet alert position</strong>.</p>
<p>And we can keep our eyes open or closed.<br />
<em> closed, as it reduces the distractions that surround me, and it makes it easier for me to focus<br />
</em> keep the eyes open and just have a soft gaze on a fixed point in front of them. </p>
<p>However you sit, try to keep that balance of being comfortable yet alert.</p>
<h3 id="14-where-and-when"><a name="user-content-14-where-and-when" href="#14-where-and-when" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>1.4 Where and when</h3>
<p>To create a great habit, I suggest trying to meditate in the same place at the same time every day</p>
<p>As for where, find a quiet place where you can minimize your distractions.</p>
<p>Having a routine sends signals to your mind and body that this is meditation time, and helps make it easier to maintain the habit. So try for <strong>the same place, same time, and in the location</strong> where you can focus.</p>
<h3 id="15-am-i-doing-it-right"><a name="user-content-15-am-i-doing-it-right" href="#15-am-i-doing-it-right" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>1.5 Am I doing it right?</h3>
<p>Well this practice can be subtle and it can takes some time.</p>
<p>calm and have more clarity when I&rsquo;m done. During a meditation if you&rsquo;re wondering, am I doing this right, the most important thing to remember in the moment is just relax, don&rsquo;t worry about it, keep going. </p>
<p>Three sign posts <em>during meditation</em> to determine if you&rsquo;re on track. <strong>freedom from thought</strong>, <strong>heightened awareness</strong>, and <strong>stillness</strong>:<br />
<em> The first is <strong>freedom from thought</strong>. Many people think that meditation is about not having thoughts. Not quite. The mind is going to produce thoughts, that&rsquo;s what it does. One important goal is to ignore the thoughts we do have. We notice them, we let them pass by, but we stay neutral. Our thoughts are moving by, but we aren&rsquo;t moving with them. We&rsquo;re not tossed around by them. We&rsquo;re free from our thoughts. <br />
</em> The next sign post is <strong>heightened awareness</strong>. When we meditate we often enter a state where we become more sensitive to outside stimulus. We become at ease and profoundly awake at the same time. <br />
* A third sign post that you&rsquo;re doing it right is <strong>stillness</strong>, the quality of stillness. Simple, but not easy. The quality of our stillness often informs the quality of our practice.</p>
<p>Over time, you may look for changes in yourself to gauge whether it&rsquo;s working for you. <br />
<em> First of all has this become a priority, are you prioritizing your practice. Is it becoming more regular and a more important part of your routine.<br />
</em> Is your awareness increasing. Perhaps you&rsquo;re becoming more aware of others around you. <br />
* And do you have a bit more space to operate versus just reacting to life. Are you becoming more open, more curious. </p>
<h3 id="16-how-long-should-i-do-this"><a name="user-content-16-how-long-should-i-do-this" href="#16-how-long-should-i-do-this" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>1.6 How long should I do this?</h3>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s when we think we don&rsquo;t have time and we&rsquo;re really stressed out that we probably need it the most.</p>
<p>Research shows that 20 minutes, even as little as 10 minutes a day for a couple months yields measurable benefits. </p>
<p>Keep all that in mind, and do what works for you. Make the practice fit you and your life, not the other way around.</p>
<h3 id="17-introducing-the-practices"><a name="user-content-17-introducing-the-practices" href="#17-introducing-the-practices" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>1.7 Introducing the practices</h3>
<p>There are lots of different types of meditations out there. <br />
H<br />
ave an open mind. Try each one of them. Perhaps try each one several times to see what works for you</p>
<h2 id="three-breaths"><a name="user-content-three-breaths" href="#three-breaths" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Three Breaths</h2>
<p>Sometimes you just need a quick practice to get centered. This exercise is only three breaths long and takes less than a minute. I might use this one if I&rsquo;m about to step into a meeting that could be stressful, or if I&rsquo;m in the middle of my work day and I need to focus or calm down. </p>
<h3 id="practice"><a name="user-content-practice" href="#practice" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Practice</h3>
<p>In this exercise, we&rsquo;re going to take a deep breath in, we&rsquo;re going to hold that breath at the top and when you gently and slowly exhale I&rsquo;m going to give you a phrase to say inwardly. At the end of your exhale, you&rsquo;ll hold the breath outside of the body and then we&rsquo;ll repeat. <br />
<em> <strong>letting go</strong><br />
</em> <strong>being here</strong><br />
<em> <strong>opening up</strong><br />
</em> start to breath naturally and normally. Perhaps expressing some gratitude to yourself for taking this time</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(deeply exhaling) Start by fully exhaling and then take a nice, long, slow inhale and hold it at the top. As you gently exhale and release that breath say to yourself: letting go. When you&rsquo;re done with the exhale, hold it outside of your body. Take a second slow inhale in, hold at the top, and as we release this breath say to yourself: being here. At the end of the exhale, hold it outside of the body and then take a third slow inhale, filling up completely and holding at the top and as you let it go, say to yourself: opening up. At the end of this third breath just start to breath naturally and normally. Perhaps expressing some gratitude to yourself for taking this time. And when you&rsquo;re ready, you can gently open your eyes and return.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="arrival"><a name="user-content-arrival" href="#arrival" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Arrival</h2>
<p>The arrival practice is a nice short practice that you can use when <strong>transitioning from one activity to another</strong>. It&rsquo;s also something you can use to start your day. It helps bring a quiet, calming energy to any moment. With groups or with a team, this is a great practice to start a meeting with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I welcome you to find a comfortable and alert position, and I invite you to close your eyes and take a deep in breath. And then let your out breath flow long, allowing yourself to relax. Repeat that a few times, just noticing your inhalations and exhalations extending a bit, allowing yourself to fully arrive in this moment, in the present. Now just breathe naturally, keeping the attention on the sensations of breathing, perhaps noticing the air passing by your nose, that little space in your nostrils. Do you notice that the temperature is different on your inhale versus your exhale? And where in your body can you feel your breath? Do you feel it in your throat? Notice the sensations of the breath in your chest and in your belly, perhaps feeling the breath in your back. Just settle into this gentle rhythm of breath, noticing these subtle breathing sensations and allowing yourself to feel comfortable with whatever is happening. Feel your body sitting here, gently expanding and contracting with the breathing. Can you feel the weight of your body? Notice, where is the body touching the ground or your chair below you? Are your feet touching the ground? If so, which part of your feet? Allow the weight of your body to sink into your chair, sink into the ground. Feel yourself being supported. With each out breath, you can let go of some of that heaviness. Just let it sink down, flow away. And with the in breath, take in the fresh air, the new moment. Each out breath, let go. Each in breath, become lighter, freer. Continue that for a bit. Each out breath, letting go. Each in breath, becoming lighter, freer. Allow yourself to fully arrive in this moment, the present. Sense the possibility. Sense the wonder of what could be, and welcome. When you&rsquo;re ready, you can slowly open your eyes, maybe stretch a bit. Bring some movement back into the body and return.</p>

<h2 id="counting-breathing"><a name="user-content-counting-breathing" href="#counting-breathing" class="headeranchor-link" aria-hidden="true"><span class="headeranchor"></span></a>Counting breathing</h2>
<p>In the following exercise, we&rsquo;ll learn the technique of counting breaths. </p>
<p>Why it works<br />
<em> Giving our mind something to do. Focus on the counting, tame the monkey mind.<br />
</em> The deep breathing activates our parasympathetic nervous system<br />
    - flush the stress hormones, like adrenaline and cortisol.<br />
    - We&rsquo;re calming the body. We&rsquo;re calming the mind. <br />
* We might start by doing this technique for just a few minutes, and over time we&rsquo;ll look to build our stamina up to 15 or 20 minutes per session.</p>
<p>How to do it:<br />
<em> start with a complete inhale, and start counting<br />

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d invite you to find a comfortable and alert position. And go ahead and exhale completely. We&rsquo;re going to count our breaths, and the way it works is as you&rsquo;re breathing in, you can say to yourself, breathing in one, and as you exhale, you can say to yourself, breathing out one. And then it continues. Breathing in two. Breathing out two. Or you could simply say in three. Out three. In four. Out four. And just continue at your own pace, counting from one to 10. When you get to 10, you can go nine and back down to one. When you get to one, you can continue back to two, and back up to 10 again. And if you get lost in you&rsquo;re counting it&rsquo;s okay, just return back to one. We want to be free of our thoughts, so we just use our breathing, we use our counting. Maintaining our focus on these two things, on the breath itself, the sensations of the breath, but also on the number. Observing our breath go in. Observing our breath go out. And just continue at your own pace. Just observing your breath going in. Observing your breath going out. And on this next exhale, just exhale completely. And resume breathing normally, no need to count. Nothing left to do. And when you&rsquo;re ready, you can open your eyes, have some movement in your body, and return.</p>

<p>4-7-8 technique</p>
<p>This is an excellent technique for falling asleep, and it&rsquo;s also great for reducing anxiety. It takes less that two minutes, and when practiced twice a day, can have impressive health benefits over time.</p>
<p>five, six, seven, eight. Good. One note, keep the tip of the tongue in the hard palate, in the fleshy part of the gums, behind your two front teeth.</p>
<p>just four cycles, recommended to do twice a day, perhaps at the beginning and the end of the day. Great for falling asleep at night</p>
<ul>
<li>breathe in for a count of four, </li>
<li>hold our breath for a count of seven, </li>
<li>exhale for a count of eight: pursing our lips like (blows air)</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ll repeat for a total of four cycles</li>
</ul>

<li>I invite you to find a comfortable but alert position, and just let your breathing extend. Let your inhalations, and exhalations stretch out, (soft waves crashing) and just let the weight of the day fall away from you. Let your shoulders relax, your eyebrows relax. Let your molars relax and just be here. Allow yourself to arrive in this moment. In this practice we&rsquo;re going to become joy. So with each breath in, breathe in joy. What does it feel like to breathe in joy? With each breath become a little lighter, a little freer. With each out breath, let go, let go of anything that is not joy. So when we breathe in, you&rsquo;re breathing in light, and joy, happiness. And when we breathe out, we&rsquo;re letting go of anything that is not. I&rsquo;m a visual person, so I like to use a color for this. As we breathe in, we visualize a bright yellow, and having that yellow fill our body. So with each in breath we become lighter, freer, and I&rsquo;m visualizing that bright yellow coming in, and with each exhale, I&rsquo;m letting go of anything that is not joy. If it&rsquo;s helpful you can visualize a dark color on the exhale for anything that is not joy. We&rsquo;re breathing in bright yellow, and breathing out anything that&rsquo;s not bright yellow. With each breath we become freer, lighter, happier. Perhaps it feels like our bodies are being lifted to the point where we&rsquo;re almost floating, and if we were to look at you from the outside, we might only see yellow, with no distinction between where the yellow and your body begin, and end. Feel this in your body. Let it lift the corners of your mouth. Let it lift your shoulders. Perhaps even think of something that gives you great joy, wonder, curiosity, love, and let that bright yellow, that feeling just overwhelm you, melt all around you, expand from your center in an infinite way, as your joy expands beyond you, into the universe, as if you are a shining sun, too bright to look at directly. Just deeply get a sense of that joy, of that lightness, and that infinite expansion, and know that you can return to this state whenever you like, whenever you need. Now that you&rsquo;ve been here, you can access this more easily, more quickly, and when you&rsquo;re ready, you can return. Start to put some movement back into your body, into your fingertips, and gently open your eyes, bringing that joy with you.</li>

<p>I invite you to find a comfortable but alert position. (soft waves crashing) Go ahead, and allow your eyes to comfortably close, and just start to let your breath extend, relaxing your belly, softening your mind, and feel the support beneath you, and let it take your weight. Start to become aware of the sounds around you. Just let them be there. Notice the light, and the shade, the air touching the surface of your body. Sense the sky above, and the horizons stretching all the way around you, the earth below supporting you. Allow your mind to empty what it no longer needs to hold onto, and let it go. Let it flow out and away. Allow your body to release what no longer needs to hold onto and let it go, flow out and away, and allow yourself to arrive in this moment, in the present, and bring your energy, your attention to your center, and ground yourself in this moment right here. <br />
Begin to sense the space around you. Become aware of the rise, and the fall of your breath. It&rsquo;s coming, and going. The sensation, the sound of your breath, the temperature. Do you notice if it&rsquo;s slightly different in temperature in the inhale versus the exhale as it goes past your nostrils? <br />
Breathe down to where the weight of your body rests below the base of your spine, <strong>your root</strong>, and breathe into your root. Let it soften, and gently expand on your breath, taking in nourishment, taking in energy. Allow your root to connect down, down to the ground below, deep in the Earth, empowering, embodying, grounding you in the here, and now. Let your root absorb what it needs, and say to yourself the words, <em>I am here, I am supported</em>. Get a deep sense of your root, and just notice what&rsquo;s important to you here. <br />
When you&rsquo;re ready, let that dissolve, and allow your awareness to move up to your belly, just below your navel, your <strong>center of emotional intelligence, of choice, creativity, movement, pleasure</strong>. Breathe into your belly. Let it gently soften, and expand on your breath, taking in nourishment, and energy. Feel a sense of balance, empowerment, motivation, and say to yourself, <em>I honor my own needs. I allow myself to be nourished.</em> <br />
Get a deep sense of this area of power around your belly. And notice what&rsquo;s most important to you here, and when you are ready, let that dissolve, and move your awareness up to the soft area below your breastbone, to your chest, your <strong>center of strength</strong>. Breathe into here, allowing the area around your chest to soften, and expand on your breath. Feel the sunshine, the bright yellow sunshine, replenishing, restoring, nurturing, and allow your center of strength to absorb what it needs. Say the words to yourself, <em>I value myself. I am enough.</em> And get a deep sense of this area around your chest, and a sense of what it&rsquo;s really important to you here. When you&rsquo;re ready, bring your attention, and your awareness to your heart, your <strong>center of self development, and unconditional love</strong>. Gently breathe into your heart, letting it soften, and expand on your breath. Feel a sense of nourishment, renewal, healing. Allow your heart to absorb what it needs, and say the words, <em>I am greatly loved. I allow myself to give, and receive love freely. I am nourished by the power of love.</em><br />
In your own time, when you&rsquo;re ready, move your attention to your neck, to your throat, your <strong>center of self expression, and personal will</strong>. Allow the area around your throat to soften, expand, and breathe. Imagine the open, and infinite blue sky. Breathe that open sky into your throat center, clearing, opening, softening the need for control, freeing self expression, and creativity. Allow your throat to absorb what it needs. Say the words, <em>I speak my truth. I express myself freely. I allow myself to go with the flow of life</em>, and notice what is important to you here.<br />
And when you&rsquo;re ready, let that dissolve, and bring your attention to your forehead, between your eyebrows, your <strong>center of wisdom, and intuition</strong>, gently allowing it to soften, and expand. Imagine the velvety indigo deep night&rsquo;s sky. And while thinking about this deep, dark sky, breathe in that soothing sky, balancing, bringing clarity, insight, and understanding. Allow your center of wisdom between your eyebrows to absorb what it needs, and say the words, <em>everything is unfolding exactly as it should. I am where I&rsquo;m supposed to be</em>. And notice what is important to you.<br />
And when you&rsquo;re ready, moving your attention to the top of your head, to your crown, your <strong>center of Oneness</strong>, allowing your crown to soften, and expand. Gently invite a sense of balancing, restoring, harmonizing. Allow your crown to absorb what it needs, and say the words, <em>I am one with the universe. I am one with the whole</em>, and take notice, what is most important to you here? <br />
When you&rsquo;re ready, bring your attention to the space above your head, about a foot above your head in open space. Get a <strong>sense of lightness, and joy, connectedness</strong>. Allow yourself to absorb what you need here, and say the words, <em>I am infinite, and feel the spaciousness</em>.<br />
When you&rsquo;re ready, come back to yourself as a whole. All the pieces together. Back to the ebb, and flow of your breath. Back to your center. Return. Breathe into your core. Say the words, <em>I am whole. I am perfect, just as I am</em>. Allow the energy of these words to bathe your mind, your body, your emotions, spirit, and absorb what you need. <br />
And in your own time, become aware of the air on the surface of your body, the sounds around you, near, and also in the distance. Become aware of the support beneath you. Notice how you feel, and hold yourself with loving kindness for the beautiful, unique, and perfect being that you are. And when you&rsquo;re ready, you can gently draw this meditation to a close.

<p>Research shows we&rsquo;re effectively programmed to <br />
<em> feel compassion for people in our in group<br />
</em> not feel compassion for those in our out group. </p>
<p>This reflects in the news, in our communities, in our politics, in the divisiveness that&rsquo;s on full display. That&rsquo;s the bad news, we&rsquo;re programmed this way. </p>
<p>The good news is we can <strong>hack the system</strong>. When we are able to see the similarities we have with others instead of focusing on the differences, we increase our ability to have compassion for them. We increase our ability to be in relationship with them and work together towards better common outcomes. </p>
<p>For example, at work, every member of our work group is on the same team. This is a built-in advantage. We may not always see eye to eye, but if we can remember that we&rsquo;re all playing for the same team and we all want the same eventual outcome, we&rsquo;ll be better off. </p>
<p>Likely, loving-kindness meditation is designed to hack that natural response system and increase our capability to feel compassion.</p></article></body></html>
