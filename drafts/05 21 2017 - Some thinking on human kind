Some thinking on human kind. 

It has always been a dream for everyone to become a better version of oneself. Some may say they want to be perfect. 

Perfection is always defeated because we are human.

you need to break youself to rebuild yourself, 

Genetic control is overwhelming, It is something that even you break free from it, your descendents will still be imprisoned when they are born. 

One thing that I found effective is some neural science methodologies that recognizes the defect of human natural and prevents them before hand. Meditation is one that I think might be useful. 

Human as a kind of animal, can never be perfect. 

Just like dog, bird and all other animals, there is a limit to humanbeings. No matter how intelligent we are, there is always another level of intelligence that we cannot even reach. 

This lead to the idea

What to think next?

To get some comfort, we say that human are emotional, which machines cannot imitate. But to the end of the day, the emotions are just some bio-chemical effects, which will somehow be modelled and imitated. The definition of emotional itself is questionable afterall. You can say that a human crying is a sign of sadness, but one day you will not be able to judge a machine what behaviour suggest what emotion of it. There might be emotions of machine that do not exist today.

Another way to escape the thought, is that in-perfection is what makes us animals special. The inperfection comes from millions of years of evolution and the complexity that we possess today as biological beings. We are so complex that with our intelligence, we cannot figure out our own puzzle yet. 

In another sense, this idea of imperfection has the same idea of "we are merely human". We could just assume that there is a ultra-intelligent existence that we imagined as God. So called supernatrual things and all that are just ultra-intelligent existence that we cannot understand as humanbeings.
