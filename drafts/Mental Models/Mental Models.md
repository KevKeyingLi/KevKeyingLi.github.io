## Information theory
C.E.Shannon, Fisher.I, Norbert Wiener

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory

### Keywords
* information noise ratio
* entropy

### Theories
* Shannon's source coding theorem(noiseless coding theorem): ideal coding to approach Shannon entropy is "Independent and identically distributed random variables"
* Noisy-channel coding theorem(sometimes Shannon's theorem or Shannon's limit)
 

## Control theory
Norbert Wiener

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory#Open-loop_and_closed-loop_(feedback)_control

### Keywords and key concepts
* feedback loop
* react instead of predict
* commonly used in management philosophy
## System theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory
### Keywords and key concepts
* A system may be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses synergy or emergent behavior
* optimizing each part of the system may not optimize the system

## Huffman Coding
In computer science and information theory, a Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression

### Investing

A combination of the three theories
* huffman coding to minimize potential risk and maximaze potential profit
* periodic revisit to re-evaluate, and respond to feedback
* a basket approach so that the portfolio works together


## Mental model with the 3 theories
* react instead of predict
* connection instead of ownership
