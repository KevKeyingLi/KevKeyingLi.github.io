Leopold Auer (Hungarian: Auer Lipót)

June 7, 1845 – July 15, 1930
Hungarian violinist, chamber music player, conductor, composer and teacher

## Early life and career
早年生活与事业
Auer was born in Veszprém in 1845 in a Jewish household. He first studied violin with a local concertmaster. At age 8 he continued his studies with Ridley Kohné at  Budapest Conservatory. His debut with the Mendelssohn concerto aroused the interest of some wealthy patrons, who sent him to Vienna for further study under a scholarship. He lived at the home of his teacher, Jakob Dont. In his memoirs, Auer wrote that Dont was the one who taught him the foundation for his violin technique. In Vienna he also attended quartet classes with Joseph Hellmesberger, Sr.


奥尔于1845年出生在维斯普雷姆（Veszprém）的一个犹太家庭中。他最初和当地的一位音乐大师学习小提琴。 8岁时，他到布达佩斯音乐学院师从Ridley Kohné。首次演出中，他演奏了门德尔松的协奏曲，吸引了一些富有的艺术赞助人的兴趣，这些赞助人出资，将他送到维也纳进一步深造。他住在他的老师Jakob Dont的家里。在他的回忆录中，奥尔写道，Dont是为他小提琴技术打下基础的人。在维也纳期间，他还参加了约瑟夫·黑尔梅斯伯格Joseph Hellmesberger，Sr的四重奏课程。

By the time Auer was 13, the scholarship money had run out. His father decided to launch his career. The income from provincial concerts was barely enough to keep father and son out of poverty. An audition with Henri Vieuxtemps in Graz was a failure. A visit to Paris proved equally unsuccessful. Auer decided to seek the advice of Joseph Joachim, then royal concertmaster at Hanover.

当奥尔13岁时，赞助人资助的奖学金已经用完了。他的父亲决定开始他的职业生涯。省级音乐会的收入只够父子二人勉强糊口。在格拉茨（Graz）与亨利·维厄当Henri Vieuxtemps的面试以失败告终，到巴黎的闯荡也不成功。奥尔决定向当时汉诺威的皇家乐团首席小提琴手约瑟夫·约阿希姆（Joseph Joachim）寻求建议。

The two years Auer spent with Joachim (1861–63) proved a turning point in his career. More than through lessons, he learned through observation and association. He was already well prepared as a violinist. What proved revelatory was exposure to the world of German music making—a world that stresses musical values over virtuoso glitter.


奥尔与约阿希姆共度的两年（1861-63）成为他职业生涯的转折点。在学习课程之外，他通过仔细观察和建立关联学到了很多东西。他早已有了成为小提琴家必备的技巧，但真正让他有了启发性改变的，是对德国音乐制作的世界的接触——一个在高超技巧之上更强调音乐价值的世界。

Auer later wrote:

“Joachim was an inspiration for me and opened before my eyes horizons of that greater art of which until then I had lived in ignorance. With him I worked not only with my hands but with my head, studying the scores of the great masters and endeavoring to penetrate the very heart of their works…. I also played a great deal of chamber music with my fellow students”

奥尔后来写道：

“约阿希姆给了我灵感与启发，拓宽了我的视野，让无知的我领略了更伟大的艺术。和他在一起，我不仅仅用我的双手去演奏，更要用我的头脑，去研习大师们的乐谱，努力推敲他们作品的精髓......我还和我的同学一起演奏了很多室内乐作品“

 Auer returned to the concert stage in 1864. Success led to his becoming concertmaster in Düsseldorf. In 1866, he assumed the same position in Hamburg; he also held a string quartet there. On a visit to London in 1868, he was invited to perform Beethoven’s Archduke Trio with pianist Anton Rubinstein and cellist Alfredo Piatti. Rubinstein was in search for a violin professor for the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and he suggested Auer. Auer agreed to a three year contract; he would actually stay for 49 years.

 1864年，奥尔重新回到音乐会舞台。成功的演出后不久，他便在杜塞尔多夫（Düsseldorf）担任乐团首席。 1866年，他又在汉堡（Hamburg）任同样的首席位置， 同时还举行了弦乐四重奏的演出。在1868年访问伦敦时，他被邀请与钢琴家安东·鲁宾斯坦（Anton Rubinstein）和大提琴家阿尔弗雷多·皮亚蒂（Alfredo Piatti）一起演奏贝多芬的“大公”三重奏（Archduke Trio）。鲁宾斯坦当时正在为他所筹备的圣彼得堡音乐学院寻找一位小提琴教授，而奥尔正是合适的人选。奥尔接受了一份为期三年的合同，他这一去就是49年。


## 俄国
 In 1868 he moved to St. Petersburg.
Russia extremely attracted Auer by the prospects of performing and teaching activities. His hot and energetic nature was captivated by the intensive musical and cultural life of the Northern Capital of Russia, and Auer, initially intended to live here only 3 years, again and again renewed the contract and together with Henri Vieuxtemps  and Henryk Wieniawski become one of the most active founder of Russian Violin School .

1868年，他搬到了圣彼得堡。
俄罗斯在表演和教学活动方面的前景深深地吸引了奥尔。俄罗斯北方首都丰富的音乐和文化生活让天性热情而有活力的奥尔着迷，而奥尔虽然最初只打算在这里生活3年，却一次又一次地重新签订合同.奥尔，亨利·维厄当（Henri Vieuxtemps）和亨里克·维尼亚夫斯基（Henryk Wieniawski）是俄罗斯小提琴学校（Russian Violin School）最活跃的初创人。

Auer got married on the 23 May 1874. His wife Nadezhda Pelikan was niece of Mikhail Azanchevsky, director of the St. Petersburg Conservatory ( 1871-1876).
They got four daughters Zoe, Maria, Nadezhda and Natalia.

奥尔于1874年5月23日结婚。他的妻子Nadezhda Pelikan是圣彼得堡音乐学院（1871-1876）主任Mikhail Azanchevsky的侄女。他们有四个女儿Zoe，Maria，Nadezhda和Natalia。


During that time he held the position of first violinist to the orchestra of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. This included the principal venue of the Imperial Ballet and Opera, the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre (until 1886), and later the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, as well as the Imperial Theatres of Peterhof and the Hermitage. For nearly 50 years, Auer performed almost all of the violin solos in the ballets performed by the Imperial Ballet, the majority of which were the work of the choreographer Marius Petipa. Many of the noted ballet composers of the day, such as Cesare Pugni, Ludwig Minkus, Riccardo Drigo, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Alexander Glazunov, wrote the violin solos of their scores especially for his talents.


在那段时间里，他担任圣彼得堡帝国剧院（St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres）管弦乐队的第一位小提琴手。这座剧院包括了帝国芭蕾舞和歌剧团（Imperial Ballet and Opera）的主要场地，皇家大剧院（Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre直到1886年），以及后来的帝国马林斯基剧院（Imperial Mariinsky Theatre），以及彼得霍夫皇家剧院（Imperial Theatres of Peterhof）和the Hermitage冬宫剧院。在近50年的时间里，奥尔演奏了几乎所有由皇家芭蕾舞团表演的芭蕾舞剧中的小提琴独奏，其中大部分都是编舞家马里乌斯·佩蒂帕（Marius Petipa）的作品。当时许多着名的芭蕾舞作曲家，如凯萨勒·普尼（Cesare Pugni），路德维希·明库斯（Ludwig Minkus），里卡多·德里戈（Riccardo Drigo），彼得·伊里奇·柴可夫斯基（Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky）和亚历山大·格拉佐诺夫（Alexander Glazunov），都专门为他的才华创作了小提琴独奏。


Sometime around 1870, Leopold decided to convert to Russian Orthodoxy.

Until 1906 he was also leader of the string quartet for the Russian Musical Society (RMS). This quartet’s concerts were as integral a part of the Saint Petersburg musical scene as their counterparts led by Joachim in Berlin. Criticism arose in later years of less-than-perfect ensemble and insufficient attention to contemporary Russian music. Nevertheless, Auer’s group performed quartets by Tchaikovsky, Alexander Borodin, Glazunov and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. The group also played music by Johannes Brahms and Robert Schumann, along with Louis Spohr, Joachim Raff and other secondary German composers.



1870年左右，利奥波德决定皈依俄罗斯东正教。

直到1906年，他还是俄罗斯音乐协会（Russian Musical Society - RMS）弦乐四重奏的带头人。就像柏林以约阿希姆（joseph Joachim）为首的四重奏，奥尔的四重奏组音乐会是圣彼得堡音乐圈里必不可少的一部分。他们既会演奏由柴可夫斯基，鲍罗丁(Alexander Borodin)，格拉佐诺夫和尼古拉·里姆斯基-科萨科夫（Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov）等俄罗斯作曲家创作的的四重奏作品，也会表演勃拉姆斯（Johannes Brahms）和舒曼（Robert Schumann）以及路易斯·施波尔（Louis Spohr），约阿希姆·拉夫（Joachim Raff）和其他德国二线作曲家的音乐。在后来的几年里，逐渐出现了“演奏组合不尽完美”，“对当代俄罗斯音乐的关注不足”的批评声。

Auer also continued performing sonatas with many great pianists. His favorite recital partner was Anna Yesipova, with whom he appeared until  her death in 1914. Other partners included Anton Rubinstein, Theodor Leschetizky, Raoul Pugno, Sergei Taneyev and Eugen d’Albert. In the 1890s, he performed cycles of all 10 Beethoven violin sonatas. He also introduced the violin and piano sonatas of Brahms.


奥尔还继续与许多伟大的钢琴家合作演奏奏鸣曲。他最喜欢的独奏伙伴是安娜·耶西波娃（Anna Yesipova）。他们有多次同台，直到她1914年去世前。其他合作伙伴包括安东·鲁宾斯坦（Anton Rubinstein），西奥多·莱谢蒂茨基（Theodor Leschetizky），拉乌尔·普尼欧（Raoul Pugno），谢尔盖·塔涅耶夫（Sergei Taneyev）和欧根·达尔伯特。在19世纪90年代，他多次演奏了贝多芬的全部10首小提琴奏鸣曲。他还引进了勃拉姆斯的小提琴和钢琴奏鸣曲。

## 美国
The Russian Revolution of 1917 changed the face of Russia forever and forced Auer’s departure the following year. He left for New York on February 7, 1918, arriving ten days later. Auer was 73 years old.  He played at Carnegie Hall on March 23, 1918 and also performed in Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. He carried with him two trunks and his Stradivarius violin. His many former pupils greeted him with open arms and a warm reception, including Mischa Elman, Efrem Zimbalist, Jascha Heifetz, and Max Rosen. He taught some private students at his home on Manhattan’s Upper West Side.
Performances in New York, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia were enormously acclaimed. Auer went on to teach at the Institute of Musical Art in New York City (later to become the Juilliard School). and at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.


1917年的俄国革命永远改变了俄罗斯的面貌，并迫使奥尔在第二年离开。73岁的他于1918年2月7日前往纽约，十天后抵达纽约。1918年3月23日他在卡内基音乐厅演出，之后在波士顿，芝加哥和费城演出。两个行李箱和他的斯特拉迪瓦里琴（Stradivarius）小提琴是他全部的家当。许多他之前的学生张开双臂迎接他，热情款待他，包括米沙·埃尔曼（Mischa Elman），Efrem Zimbalist，亚莎·海菲兹（Jascha Heifetz）和马克斯·罗森（Max Rosen）。他在曼哈顿上西区的家里教了一些私课学生。
他在纽约，波士顿，芝加哥和费城的表演获得了极高的赞赏。奥尔继续在纽约市音乐艺术学院（后来成为茱莉亚音乐学院Juilliard School）以及费城柯蒂斯音乐学院任教。

In 1926, Auer became a U.S. citizen, once again finding a niche to satisfy his talent and passion for his art. When he put his memories into a book, My Long Life in Music, in 1923, Auer said, “All that remains is my recollections, those memories deeply graven in my mind, an invisible cupboard lined with innumerable drawers, from which I have taken out and set down in the following pages whatever seemed worthy of recording for those interested in the musical life of Russia since the middle of the nineteenth century.”

In 1928 he joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He died in 1930 in Loschwitz, a suburb of Dresden, Germany and was interred in the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

1926年，奥尔成为美国公民，再次找到一个可以满足他的艺术才华和热情的地方。奥尔在1923年把自己的记忆写进了一本书《我漫长的音乐生涯》（"My Long Life in Music"），奥尔说：“剩下的就是我的回忆，那些记忆在我脑海里深深地刻画，一个无形的橱柜，里面摆着无数的抽屉，我从其中拿出值得记录的，写成这本书，留给对十九世纪中叶以来俄罗斯音乐生活感兴趣的人们。“

1928年，他加入了费城柯蒂斯音乐学院。他于1930年在德国德累斯顿（Dresden）郊区的洛什维茨（Loschwitz）去世，葬于纽约州哈兹代尔（Hartsdale）的Ferncliff墓地。

## 演奏 Playing
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky was especially taken with Auer’s playing. Reviewing an 1874 appearance in Moscow, Tchaikovsky praised Auer’s “great expressivity, the thoughtful finesse and poetry of the interpretation.”

This finesse and poetry came at a tremendous price. Auer suffered as a performer from poorly formed hands. He had to work incessantly, with an iron determination, just to keep his technique in shape. He wrote, “My hands are so weak and their conformation is so poor that when I have not played the violin for several successive days, and then take up the instrument, I feel as if I had altogether lost the facility of playing.”

Despite this handicap, Auer achieved much through constant work. His tone was small but ingratiating, his technique polished and elegant. His playing lacked fire, but he made up for it with a classic nobility. After he arrived in the United States, he made some recordings which bear this out. They show the violinist in excellent shape technically, with impeccable intonation, incisive rhythm and tasteful playing.

His musical tastes were conservative and refined. He liked virtuoso works by Henri Vieuxtemps and Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst and used those works in his teaching. Once a student objected to playing Ernst’s Othello Fantasy because it was bad music. Auer did not back down. “You’ll play it until it sounds like good music,” he thundered at the student, “and you’ll play nothing else.”  He played little Bach. Never did he ever assign any of Bach’s solo concertos to a student. The Double Concerto, however, was one of his favorites.

彼得·伊里奇·柴可夫斯基尤其欣赏奥尔的演奏。回顾1874年在莫斯科的一次演出，柴可夫斯基赞扬了奥尔的“伟大的表现力，考究的技艺和如诗的阐释”。

为了这高超的技巧和诗化的演绎，奥尔付出了巨大的代价。作为一个表演者，奥尔不尽完美的手型让他吃尽了苦头。为了保持住他的技术，他不得不以钢铁般的意志不停地练习。他写道：“我的双手非常虚弱，他们的构造非常糟糕，以至于当我连续几天没有拉小提琴，然后拿起乐器时，我觉得好像完全失去了演奏的基本能力。”

尽管有这样的不便，奥尔依旧通过不断的练习取得了很大的成就。他的演奏虽显小气但却讨人喜欢，他的技巧也格外优雅。他的演奏虽然缺乏激情，但其中却流露出典雅的贵族气质。抵达美国后，他录制的一些唱片展现了这样的特质：高超的技巧，无瑕的音准，精确的节奏和优雅的演奏。

他的音乐品味保守而精致。他喜欢亨利·维厄当（Henri Vieuxtemps）和海因里希·威尔海姆·恩斯特（Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst）精良的技巧，并在他的教学中使用他们作品。一位学生曾以恩斯特的《“奥赛罗”主题变奏与幻想曲》是糟糕的音乐为由，而反对演奏，奥尔并没有退缩。“你必须练这部作品，直到它听起来像是好音乐，”他对学生大声斥道，“其他的什么也不要练。”他很少演奏巴赫的音乐，也从来没有将任何巴赫的独奏协奏曲给学生练习。然而，巴赫的双小提琴协奏曲却是他的最爱之一。

## 指挥 Conducting
Auer was also active as a conductor. He was in charge of the Russian Musical Society orchestral concerts intermittently in the 1880s and 90s. He was always willing to mount the podium to accompany a famous foreign soloist—as he did when Joachim visited Russia—and did the same for his students concertizing abroad.

奥尔还是一名活跃的指挥。他在19世纪80年代和90年代间歇性地负责俄罗斯音乐协会（Russian Musical Society）的管弦乐音乐会。当有著名的外国独奏家来访，比如约阿希姆（Joachim）访问俄罗斯时，他总是乐于以指挥的身份与之同台。他的学生在国外进行协奏演出时，他也时常负责指挥。

## 教学
Auer is remembered as one of the most important pedagogues of the violin, and was one of the most sought-after teachers for gifted pupils. Many famous virtuoso violinists were among his pupils, including Mischa Elman, Konstanty Gorski, Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein, Toscha Seidel, Efrem Zimbalist, Georges Boulanger,Benno Rabinof, Kathleen Parlow, Oscar Shumsky, Paul Stassevitch, and Sasha Lasserson. Auer also taught the young Clara Rockmore , who later became one of the world’s foremost exponents of the  theremin. 
During his 49 years teaching at the St. Petersburg Concervatory he tough more than 275 students.

Like pianist Franz Liszt in his teaching, Auer did not focus on technical matters with his students. Instead, he guided their interpretations and concepts of music. If a student ran into a technical problem, Auer did not offer any solutions. Neither was he inclined to pick up a bow to demonstrate a passage. Nevertheless, he was a stickler for technical accuracy. Fearing to ask Auer themselves, many students turned to each other for help. (Paradoxically, in the years before 1900 when Auer focused more closely on technical details, he did not turn out any significant students.)

While Auer valued talent, he considered it no excuse for lack of discipline, sloppiness or absenteeism. He demanded punctual attendance. He expected intelligent work habits and attention to detail. Lessons were as grueling as recital performances—in fact, the two were practically identical.


奥尔被认为是最重要的小提琴教育家之一，也是最受天才学生追随的导师之一。许多著名的小提琴家都是他的学生，包括Mischa Elman，Konstanty Gorski，Jascha Heifetz，Nathan Milstein，Toscha Seidel，Efrem Zimbalist，Georges Boulanger，Benno Rabinof，Kathleen Parlow，Oscar Shumsky，Paul Stassevitch和Sasha Lasserson。奥尔还教导了年轻的克拉拉·洛克莫尔（Clara Rockmore），后来她成为了特雷门琴（theremin）最重要的的演奏者与推广者。在圣彼得堡音乐学院教学49年期间，他教授了超过275名学生。

就像钢琴家弗朗茨·李斯特（Franz Liszt）的教学一样，奥尔并没有把重点放在他的学生的技巧问题上，而是更注重他们对音乐的解释和感知能力的培养。如果学生遇到技巧问题，奥尔并不会提供任何解决方案。他也不会于拿起弓来做演奏示范。这似乎与奥尔自己对技巧准确性的执着向矛盾。由于害怕向奥尔请教，许多学生只好互相帮助。（有意思的是，在1900年之前，当奥尔更专注于技术细节时，他并没有教出任何出众的学生。）

虽然奥尔注重天赋，但他认为缺乏纪律，懒散和旷课都是不能允许的。他要求学生准时出席。他希望每个学生都能有聪明的练习习惯和对细节的关注。在他的严格要求下，上课就像独奏表演一样艰苦。或者说，上他的课程其实跟进行独奏表演是一模一样的。


In lieu of weekly lessons, students were required to bring a complete movement of a major work. This usually demanded more than a week to prepare. Once a student felt ready to play this work, he had to inscribe his name 10 days prior to the class meeting. The student was expected to have his instrument concert ready and to be dressed accordingly. An accompanist was provided. An audience watched—comprised not only of students and parents, but also often of distinguished guests and prominent musicians. Auer arrived for the lesson punctually; everything was supposed to be in place by the time he arrived. During the lesson, Auer would walk around the room, observing, correcting, exhorting, scolding, shaping the interpretation. “We did not dare cross the threshold of the classroom with a half-ready performance,” one student remembered.

Admission to Auer’s class was a privilege won by talent. Remaining there was a test of endurance and hard work. Auer could be stern, severe, harsh. One unfortunate student was ejected regularly, with the music thrown after him. Auer valued musical vitality and enthusiasm. He hated lifeless, anemic playing and was not above poking a bow into a student’s ribs, demanding more “krov.” (The word literally means “blood” but can also be used to mean fire or vivacity.)

While Auer pushed his students to their limits, he also remained devoted to them. He remained solicitous of their material needs. He helped them obtain scholarships, patrons and better instruments. He used his influence in high government offices to obtain residence permits for his Jewish students. He shaped his students’ personalities. He gave them style, taste, musical breeding. He also broadened their horizons. He made them read books, guided their behavior and career choices and polish their social graces. He also insisted that his students learn a foreign language if an international career was expected.

Even after a student started a career, Auer would watch with a paternal eye. He wrote countless letters of recommendation to conductors and concert agents. When Mischa Elman was preparing for his London debut, Auer traveled there to coach him. He also continued work with Efrem Zimbalist and Kathleen Parlow after their debuts.

在每周课程之外，奥尔要求学生练习一部重要作品的一个乐章。这通常需要一个多星期的准备时间。一旦学生准备好演奏这部作品，他要在上课前10天登记自己的名字。学生需要以音乐会的标准准备好他的乐器，并相应地穿着。课上会有人伴奏，也会有观众到场观看。观众不仅包括学生和家长，还时常有贵宾和著名的音乐家。奥尔会准时到达，当他到达时，一切都应该准备就绪。在课程中，奥尔将在房间里走动，观察并纠正演奏的细节，有时劝诫，有时责骂，并且对作品的阐释进行讲解。一位学生记得，“我们的曲子如果不是完全准备好，我们根本不敢跨进那个教室的门槛。”

入读奥尔的班级是拥有天赋才能获得的特权，入读以后就要面对耐力和努力的考验。奥尔是极其严厉的，时常会有不幸的学生被驱逐退学。奥尔重视音乐的活力和热情。没有活力，气息奄奄的演奏是他最讨厌的，讨厌到他恨不得要把琴弓插进学生的肋骨。他要求学生的演奏要有更多的“血性”（krov - 字面意思是“血”，但也可以用来表示热情和活力。）

奥尔在演奏上要求他的学生达到极致，在生活中他对学生也是全心的付出。他热切关注他们的物质需求。他帮助他们获得奖学金，赞助人和更好的乐器。他利用自己在高层政府部门的影响力，为犹太学生获取居留许可。他塑造了学生的个性。他给了他们风格，品味，和音乐滋养。他也拓宽了他们的视野。他让他们阅读书籍，指导他们的行为和职业选择，并磨练他们的社交礼仪。他还坚持要求那些可能在其他国家发展的学生，学习一门外语。

即使在学生开始职业生涯之后，奥尔也会以父亲的眼光默默关注。他给指挥和演唱会代理人写了无数的推荐信。当米莎·埃尔曼（Mischa Elman）为他伦敦的首演做准备时，奥尔前往那里指导他。Efrem Zimbalist和Kathleen Parlow首次亮相之后，他还继续在事业上帮助他们。


## Dedications 献礼

A number of composers dedicated pieces to Auer. One such case was Tchaikovsky’s Violin Concerto, which, however, he initially chose not to play. This was not because he regarded the work as “unplayable”, as some sources say, but because he felt that “some of the passages were not suited to the character of the instrument, and that, however perfectly rendered, they would not sound as well as the composer had imagined”. He did play the work later in his career, with the alterations in certain passages that he felt were necessary. Performances of the Tchaikovsky concerto by his students (with the exception of Nathan Milstein’s) were also based on Auer’s edition. Another work Tchaikovsky had dedicated to Auer was the Sérénade mélancolique of 1875. After their conflict over the Violin Concerto, Tchaikovsky also withdrew the Sérénade’s dedication to Auer.

许多作曲家都专为Auer创作过作品。其中一个就是柴可夫斯基的小提琴协奏曲（Violin Concerto in D major, Op. 35）。他最初选择不演奏这部作品。据说这并不是因为他认为这部作品“无法演奏”，而是因为他觉得“有些乐段不适合小提琴的特性，而且无论如何完美地呈现，它们都不会像作曲家所想象的那样“。在他的职业生涯后期，他对一些乐段的进行了他认为必要的改动，最终还是演奏了这部作品。他的学生们对柴可夫斯基协奏曲的演出（除了内森·米尔斯坦（Nathan Milstein）之外）也都是基于奥尔的版本。柴可夫斯基献给奥尔的另一部作品是1875年的《忧伤小夜曲》（Sérénade mélancolique）。他们在小提琴协奏曲的演奏上发生冲突后，柴可夫斯基也撤回了《忧伤小夜曲》对奥尔的献礼。

## 创作与写作

Auer wrote a small number of works for his instrument, including the Rhapsodie hongroise for violin and piano. He also wrote a number of cadenzas for other composers’ violin concertos including those by Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Brahms (see Beethoven Violin Concerto and Brahms Violin Concerto). He also wrote three books: Violin Playing as I Teach It (1920), My Long Life in Music (1923) and Violin Master Works and Their Interpretation (1925). He also wrote an arrangement for Paganini’s 24th Caprice (with Schumann’s piano accompaniment)later performed by Jascha Heifetz, Henryk Szeryng and Ivry Gitlis, in which the final variation is removed and his own composed. There are also alterations to various passages throughout the piece. Auer edited much of the standard repertoire, concertos, short pieces and all of Bach’s solo works. His editions are published mostly by Carl Fischer. He also transcribed a great amount of works for the violin including some of Chopin’s preludes.

奥尔为小提琴写了为数不多一些作品，包括《小提琴和钢琴匈牙利狂想曲》（Rhapsodie hongroise for violine and piano)。他还为其他作曲家的小提琴协奏曲写了一些独奏乐段，包括贝多芬，莫扎特和勃拉姆斯（参见贝多芬小提琴协奏曲和勃拉姆斯小提琴协奏曲）。他还写了三本书：《Violin Playing as I Teach It》(1920), 《My Long Life in Music》(1923)和《Violin Master Works and Their Interpretation》(1925)。他还改编了帕格尼尼（Paganini）的第24号随想曲（伴随着舒曼的钢琴伴奏）。后来由亚莎·海菲兹（Jascha Heifetz），Henryk Szeryng和Ivry Gitlis演奏。他将最后的变奏改编成自己创作的部分，并改写了贯穿整个作品的多个乐段。奥尔编辑了许多音乐会标准曲目，协奏曲，短片和巴赫的所有独奏作品。他改编的版本主要由Carl Fischer出版。他还为小提琴转录了大量其他乐器的作品，包括肖邦的一些前奏曲。
