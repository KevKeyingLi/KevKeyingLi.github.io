# Laying the groundwork for success with meditation
## 1.1 intention is important
Intention helps us get clear on what we're trying to achieve, and gives us a better chance of creating the habit of a regular practice. 

## 1.2 Basic body science


We have two nervous systems in our bodies,
* the sympathetic, known as fight or flight
    - Our pupils dilate so we can see better in the dark.
    - Our blood gets stickier so that if we're injured, we won't bleed to death.
    - Our lungs and muscles get more oxygen, and our bodies are flooded with the stress hormones **cortisol** and adrenaline.
* the parasympathetic system, known as rest and digest.
    - opposite of fight or flight. Our muscles relax, the cortisol and adrenaline start to flush from our bodies, and the cognitive parts of our brains turn back on.

Stress, over time, can lead to serious health issues. 
When we're carrying so many stress hormones, like **cortisol**, for so long, it can lead to memory loss, serious health problems, even the shrinking of the cognitive parts of our brains. The good news is we know how to hack the system.

One option that's always available to us is our breath. Just taking a few conscious, deep breaths starts to activate the parasympathetic system, and this helps break up some of the mental spinning we often get caught in, and our bodies start to relax

## 1.3 Posture
it's helpful to be seated when meditating. We find a **comfortable, yet alert position**.

And we can keep our eyes open or closed.
* closed, as it reduces the distractions that surround me, and it makes it easier for me to focus
* keep the eyes open and just have a soft gaze on a fixed point in front of them. 

However you sit, try to keep that balance of being comfortable yet alert.

## 1.4 Where and when

To create a great habit, I suggest trying to meditate in the same place at the same time every day

As for where, find a quiet place where you can minimize your distractions.

Having a routine sends signals to your mind and body that this is meditation time, and helps make it easier to maintain the habit. So try for **the same place, same time, and in the location** where you can focus.

## 1.5 Am I doing it right?
Well this practice can be subtle and it can takes some time.

calm and have more clarity when I'm done. During a meditation if you're wondering, am I doing this right, the most important thing to remember in the moment is just relax, don't worry about it, keep going. 

Three sign posts *during meditation* to determine if you're on track. **freedom from thought**, **heightened awareness**, and **stillness**:
* The first is **freedom from thought**. Many people think that meditation is about not having thoughts. Not quite. The mind is going to produce thoughts, that's what it does. One important goal is to ignore the thoughts we do have. We notice them, we let them pass by, but we stay neutral. Our thoughts are moving by, but we aren't moving with them. We're not tossed around by them. We're free from our thoughts. 
* The next sign post is **heightened awareness**. When we meditate we often enter a state where we become more sensitive to outside stimulus. We become at ease and profoundly awake at the same time. 
* A third sign post that you're doing it right is **stillness**, the quality of stillness. Simple, but not easy. The quality of our stillness often informs the quality of our practice.


Over time, you may look for changes in yourself to gauge whether it's working for you. 
* First of all has this become a priority, are you prioritizing your practice. Is it becoming more regular and a more important part of your routine.
* Is your awareness increasing. Perhaps you're becoming more aware of others around you. 
* And do you have a bit more space to operate versus just reacting to life. Are you becoming more open, more curious. 

## 1.6 How long should I do this?

You know, it's when we think we don't have time and we're really stressed out that we probably need it the most.

Research shows that 20 minutes, even as little as 10 minutes a day for a couple months yields measurable benefits. 

Keep all that in mind, and do what works for you. Make the practice fit you and your life, not the other way around.

## 1.7 Introducing the practices
There are lots of different types of meditations out there. 
H
ave an open mind. Try each one of them. Perhaps try each one several times to see what works for you

# Three Breaths

Sometimes you just need a quick practice to get centered. This exercise is only three breaths long and takes less than a minute. I might use this one if I'm about to step into a meeting that could be stressful, or if I'm in the middle of my work day and I need to focus or calm down. 

## Practice
In this exercise, we're going to take a deep breath in, we're going to hold that breath at the top and when you gently and slowly exhale I'm going to give you a phrase to say inwardly. At the end of your exhale, you'll hold the breath outside of the body and then we'll repeat. 
* **letting go**
* **being here**
* **opening up**
* start to breath naturally and normally. Perhaps expressing some gratitude to yourself for taking this time


>(deeply exhaling) Start by fully exhaling and then take a nice, long, slow inhale and hold it at the top. As you gently exhale and release that breath say to yourself: letting go. When you're done with the exhale, hold it outside of your body. Take a second slow inhale in, hold at the top, and as we release this breath say to yourself: being here. At the end of the exhale, hold it outside of the body and then take a third slow inhale, filling up completely and holding at the top and as you let it go, say to yourself: opening up. At the end of this third breath just start to breath naturally and normally. Perhaps expressing some gratitude to yourself for taking this time. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes and return.

# Arrival
The arrival practice is a nice short practice that you can use when **transitioning from one activity to another**. It's also something you can use to start your day. It helps bring a quiet, calming energy to any moment. With groups or with a team, this is a great practice to start a meeting with.

> I welcome you to find a comfortable and alert position, and I invite you to close your eyes and take a deep in breath. And then let your out breath flow long, allowing yourself to relax. Repeat that a few times, just noticing your inhalations and exhalations extending a bit, allowing yourself to fully arrive in this moment, in the present. Now just breathe naturally, keeping the attention on the sensations of breathing, perhaps noticing the air passing by your nose, that little space in your nostrils. Do you notice that the temperature is different on your inhale versus your exhale? And where in your body can you feel your breath? Do you feel it in your throat? Notice the sensations of the breath in your chest and in your belly, perhaps feeling the breath in your back. Just settle into this gentle rhythm of breath, noticing these subtle breathing sensations and allowing yourself to feel comfortable with whatever is happening. Feel your body sitting here, gently expanding and contracting with the breathing. Can you feel the weight of your body? Notice, where is the body touching the ground or your chair below you? Are your feet touching the ground? If so, which part of your feet? Allow the weight of your body to sink into your chair, sink into the ground. Feel yourself being supported. With each out breath, you can let go of some of that heaviness. Just let it sink down, flow away. And with the in breath, take in the fresh air, the new moment. Each out breath, let go. Each in breath, become lighter, freer. Continue that for a bit. Each out breath, letting go. Each in breath, becoming lighter, freer. Allow yourself to fully arrive in this moment, the present. Sense the possibility. Sense the wonder of what could be, and welcome. When you're ready, you can slowly open your eyes, maybe stretch a bit. Bring some movement back into the body and return.
