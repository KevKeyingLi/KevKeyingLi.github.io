Deep learning with Neural Network and Tensorflow

## The idea of neural network
biological neural network:
* Dendrites
* Axon
* Axon terminal
* Synapse(递质)

Artificial network:

for each neuron
* input x1,x2,x3...
* sum them with weights
* threashold them, step function or sigmold function
* output 1 or 0

A neural network is formed by layers of neurons
with hidden layers, from input to output are hidden layer 1, 2, 3...
Neural network with more than 1 hidden layer is considered a deep neural network.

The input data need to be huge, 60,000 could be still pretty small. **b.c.** Not like SVM, which only has two parameters v and b, and convex, **the optimization problem of neural network is not convex, there are a lot of independent weights that we need to determine** 

We still dont know what is happening in the hidden layers, why they have such good performance. 

## Tensorflow
Syntax are different in different frameworks, the modelling are the same.
