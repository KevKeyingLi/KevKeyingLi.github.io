2019-12-30 Time Management Fundamental

## 

3 principles
* space
* mind
* time

# 1 laying the Productivity Groundwork
* Recommend this course to be finished in 1 or 2 sitting. 
* schedule the time to complete it
* complete the course at your workspace, for hands-on
* when asked to do something in the video, do it as then, right away. Emphasize on taking action. 
* focus on a **lasting change**, set that as a goal. 

new tech is not key, but methodology. 
### 1.2 Understanding the focus chaos scale
This course is build to help ppl with simplified and easy rules to follow. 

### 1.3 find your personal motivation for lasting change
We need a strong motivation, ask yourself: What would you do if you had an extra 10 hours per week?

Timeless principle

# 2 Obstacle to Productivity
### 2.1 multitasking - disastrous to time management
Switch tasking is a thief

multitasking is switching tasks, and is slow...

### 2.2 consequences of multitasking/switchtasking
* time increases
* quality of work decreases when switching task
* stress level increases! 

### 2.3 Three principles of productivity
Space, Mind and Time to be more productive and focused
#### Space
**As few gathering points as possible.**

> Gathering point: a place to gather unprocessed items
> e.g. pile of paperwork, email inbox, voicemail boxes, receipts, stuff in your pocket...

#### Mind
Keep your mind clear

**Your mind is not a gathering point.**

This course will help you to get all the distractions/interruptions out of your mind. 


#### Time
Be conscious of what's important. 
create boundaries to protect attention. 

**identify your MVAs, most valuable activities, and underspend time**
and create budget to spend time on those MVAs

Underspending time, and never go over budget. 

# 3 Productivity Principle 1 Space:
## 3.1 Taking an inventory of your gathering points.

Gathering point: a place to gather **unprocessed items**
* tasks
* todos
* emails
* assignments
* ...
You haven't decide, **what** to do with it, **when** to do it, or **where** it belongs.


Average 30~40 gathering points per person, as low as 12 as high as 100. 

Target for this training: 6 or less

## 3.2 narrow your gathering points
Approved Gathering Points
Six gathering points he recomemnds: 
1. Physical Inbox: Anything physical and unprocessed should go. 
2. A portable inbox: mobile extension of you inbox. One spot in your briefcase, or one pocket in your planner. 
3. A notepad: unprocessed items and general notes. Physical/Electronic
4. One email inbox. 
5. One voicemail
6. OPTIONAL: Wild card

~My note: from his recommendation: there is no need for anything at home...~
Scratch that, he later mentioned work vs personal. 
## 3.3 Setting up an inbox gathering point.
Anything out of place/unresolved/don't have a scheduled time. 
Anything, paper, receipts, books, magzines...

Instead of putting things away when they are out of place, put things into inbox. 

And at a scheduled time, we go through that inbox, to clear things up at least once a week... discuss later. 

Let me just call it a **Week Box**, as long it can hold your stuff up to a week, it's large enough. 

## 3.4 Portable inbox
Anything we get when we are not near our inbox, we use our portable inbox as an extension. 

Just one slot in your briefcase, not the whole thing.

## 3.5 Getting the most from a notepad
A mix of non-action items/notes and actionable items. 

digital or paper

Lecturer uses Evernote to 
* gather notes
* take pictures
* record notes to self

Best practices to gather items to notepads
* clearly indicate action items. separate them from general notes by adding some symbol. e.g. an open checkbox.
* when you are in office, or near your inbox, rip off all the pages to your inbox. blank slate each day.
* if digital, move the processed items to an archive folder. 

Decide your notepad -> google keep for now. 

## Consolidate multiple email accounts
recommend one email inbox. 
if possible, processing your work and life email at one place is more efficient. 

**Handling emails in one place can help you make decisions faster and easier.**


## Consolidate multiple voicemail accounts
* Create only one place for voicemail, setup call forwarding. 
* delegate responsibility for checking voicemail. - spouse/assistance
* eliminate voicemail completely. Voicemail transcription/voice to email services.

This reduces switching between voice mail accounts. 


## Wild card
* a separate email
* text messages.
* TODO list - few ppl use this productively. Instead of checking items off your todo list by doing them, check them off, when you process them, and move the item to your calendar. 
* social networks, if needed


Processing is to decide:
* what to do with it
* when to do it
* where its home is.

## Separating work and personal gathering points.
Avoid having two gathering points **if possible**.

The more gathering points you have, the more switch you make. 

Keep gathering points down:
* reduce mistake
* reduce stress
* increase efficiency

Keep in mind: Processing is not completing tasks. 

# 4 Mind
A mind unclutered with todos, unresolved ideas, action items...

To have a system that helps with taking all the ideas that pops into one's mind and store it outside of mind.

use the approved gathering points. 

When a though come up, write a note, and toss it into inbox. 

if you find out you process some certain gathering point better then others. **Put unresolved ideas into your favorite gathering point**


## 4.2 Clearing your mind of to-dos with mental triggers
1. read through the trigger list
2. write down anything unresolved
3. continue on the list

## 4.3 set a mind clearing schedule
**Set up a time every 3 month/quarter to clear up tasks in mind.**

Everytime go through the mental trigger list just like first time. 

## 4.4 taking the next step to keeping your mind clear

What to do with the todo list will come in following chapters. 

**Cultivate the habit of clearing your mind *immediately***

Your mind is not an acceptable gathering point. 

# 5 Time
## Choosing the right calendar for you
paper vs digital

### Paper planner
a weekly planner that shows the hours

Limitations:
* recurring appointments
* bulky
* loss/damage

### Digital Calendar
* fast
* accessible
* portable

Don't skimp, choose the best

Best if you just use one calendar, that could sync. So much less attention switching. 

## Effective Calendar Usage

1. Think of your calendar as you **time budget**. Time debt takes interests -> switching cost. *Schedule almost everything*. 
2. Avoid double booking. Never attempt multi-task
3. Add appointments immediately. Never commit to an appointment until putting it into your calendar. 
4. Scedule buffer/travel time for appointments
5. Think of your calendar as a commitment to others and yourself. 
6. Think long term. Be comfortable to schedule into the future. 

Procrastination can be a positive thing if you're using a schedule and are committed to following that schedule. In fact, shifting from a "now" mindset to a "when" mindset will reduce a lot of switching cost in your day.

## Say no to others.

Say no more often than you say yes. Tactically and gracefully. 

1. ask for requests via email. 
2. When say "yes", ask when.
3. if not now, when? 

## say no to yourself
1. create a perhaps list. Ideas that are not commited, have no immediate impact, and but you are interested. 

Review the list every 1~3 month. 


2. When? ask yourself when you will be able to do it. 

Do I need to do this now, or can I do it later. 

Don't think in terms of days/weeks. Think of in months, years...

Ask when is the latest I can complete this? -> focus on current tasks, and not distracted by other ideas. 


# 6 Eqquipping yourself for action
Before going into next chapter
* ensure you are in your workspace
* Budget time. best one sitting, may take multiple hours. 
* check all proper resources are available. - resource checklist in exercise file. 
    - Inbox
    - 8 cardboard/plastic boxes, 
    - electronic labeler(No not for me, I am not in a document heavy profession)
    - Storage wallet. CD/DVD
    - hanging folders
    - manila folders
    - alphabetical guides for folders.(optional)
    - stacking trays: home or place to put processed items temporarily
        + horizontal over verticel


# 7 Gathering to the Inbox.

## Prep to gather
Now we start taking actions, start from gathering. 

reduce number of physical gathering points. 

**Processed** means: you know what to do with it, you know when to do it, and you know where it belongs
**Unprocessed**: any one of the three things above is missing, what, when, where, it's unprossessed, and we need to gather it. 

**Everything has a home, and no visitors allowed.**

If something is in its correct home, it's where it belongs, it's processed and don't need gathering. 

Set up a temporary box: One week box. For each item, if you'll need to use this or take care of this during the next week, put it into the one week box. This box is where you'll start processing. 

Other things go to other boxes. 

## Gathering desk
### principles and reasons
This section talks about the why and how of gathering. It's kind of repetitive. Jump to the next section for steps if needed.

The more gathering points you have the more switches will take place in your day making you much less productive.

At this point you should have a series of empty boxes, about six to eight to be safe, including one special box set side - the temporary one-week box. For this gathering session only this one-week box is where you put any unprocessed item you need to deal with or access during the next week.

Principle: **"Everything has a home, and no visitors allowed"**
 
Take everything that is unprocessed into the giant inbox, start from desk:
* sticky notes: Sticky notes are good for one thing and one thing only - making notes for someone else. You will use calendar for yourself
* pens, scissors, notepads...

Principle for homes:
* Things that you use multiple times a day, you may want to be able to have them right at hand. 
* Things that you maybe use once a week you want to have at some place like the drawers. 
* Things that you use less than once a month, you can have them out of the room

It's stressful and draining to see the mess on your desk. Always, when you see something out of place you put it in the inbox. This will avoid alot of switching cost in the future. 

Compare this to the "binge and purge organization", where people allow the disorder to grow until they say, "I can't take it anymore", and then they take a whole day to organize. This repeats over and over, and it's time-consuming and stressful. 

As you're gathering, keep telling yourself, "Everything has a home, no visitors allowed." Any item that violates that rule, take it out and throw it in the inbox.

### the steps
1. move all unprocessed items into one big inbox. 
2. put any items that need to be dealt with or accessed in the next week into the temporary one-week inbox. 
3. don't throw anything away. 
4. remove anything that is visiting in the wrong home. These are unprocessed items.
5. dump any miscellaneous drawers or files into the inbox. These are unprocessed items.
6. create more homes for items as necessary.
7. label homes as you create them

**cultivate the habit of never putting anything unprocessed anywhere other than your inbox**

## Gathering elsewhere
The principle is the same **"Everything has a home, and no visitors allowed"**

* We need to cover every single area where you might have gathering points. we need to gather items from all of your existing gathering points. Please be absolutely thorough when it comes to gathering.
* Large items? make a note to deal with it later and put that note into one of your approved gathering points. This will save us some space and time during gathering. 
* Any kind of aesthetic changes that you want to make to your office, anything that you see, write down a note and put it into an approved gathering point. 
* After finishing up with the office, do you have any other gathering points to consider? car? home office? home? basement or garage? We also need to gather from those areas. Schedule some time in the future 30 to 60 days to do these.

Once you complete the entire gathering process for every aspect of your life, you'll find that a strong habit has formed, and you'll find it easier to avoid falling back into binge and purge organization. 

When you put all of the unprocessed items into one place but don't know what to do with it. Next chapter shows how to handle every single item in all of those boxes.

# Understanding Processing
## Intro Master the what, when where processing system

**Processing** is simply the act of deciding what the next step is to completing something, when you're going to do it, and where its home is. What, when, where processing is at the heart of helping you master your time

One item at a time, no switch tasking. Ask the questions:
* what is the next step? what is the next step I must take to move this thing toward completion
* when will it be done? 
* Where is it's home? 

for the first hour or so that you use this new system, ask yourself these questions out loud

After understanding how to ask these questions, we need to setup a processing schedule.

Rather than processing randomly throughout the day, we're going to create a consistent schedule to go through this processing.


## What is the next step? in depth
### In summary
* when considering one unprocessed item, you ask yourself what the next step is, and stay focused until you decide on that step.
* If it isn't something you want to be doing with your life, then disengage from it. 
* Sometimes, the best step is to delegate it to someone else, and waiting is an action which may be appropriate. Waiting -> the question of when. 

#### Take the time to think, don't skip

Take the time to think about this and make a clear decision. It usually takes only five to ten seconds of mental effort to make a clear decision about what the next step is. 

Sometimes people pick up an item and are uncertain in any way about the next step, they put it back in the box and skip over it to something easier. Please don't do that. Hang in there, and maintain focus on answering this question: what is the next step? 

Don't worry about answering this question perfectly. Just give it your best guess. 

#### Know to disengage and delegate
Once you've decided what the next step is, you may want to consider briefly, **is this something I want to be doing with my life**? It's important to **make a conscious choice**. **If the item you're processing doesn't line up with what you want out of life, disengage from it. _Disengage means find a way to get out of it_. Find someone else to fulfill the obligation, or just plain tell yourself, "I'm not going to spend any more time working on this thing".** 

Perhaps, instead of disengaging completely, you want to **delegate** the action to someone else. 
* Many of the steps you take, no matter how important they are, are better handled by others. 
* Perhaps someone else is better qualified to do them
* or perhaps, it's a more valuable use of someone else's time, where your time is more valuable when spent focused elsewhere.

#### Sometimes you need to wait
Also, be aware that the next step may be waiting for, meaning you're waiting for something to come to you. Waiting is an action, and is sometimes appropriate. Waiting is especially appropriate if you delegate that step to someone else. I remember this concept with a little rule of thumb: **a delegate out is a waiting for in**. Whenever you delegate, create a step for yourself, reminding you that you're waiting for them to complete it. The next processing question, "When will it be done?", will help you determine how long to wait. 

## When will it be done
When: when to do that step you decided to do. 
### In summary
* **be specific** when answering the when will it be done question
* To determine when is the best:
   - do it now if it can be done in five minutes or less
   - calendar it if it will take more than 15 minutes or is time sensitive
   - use a task reminder for everything else
* group repetitive tasks
* leave space between appointments.

### Be specific
While determining the "when" for your action step **be specific**. Decide on both the date and the time.

### When is best: 
1. if the item can be done in 5 minutes or less do it right then, do it now. 
    - **Why five minutes?** The switching cost alone is at least two to three minutes, so if something can be done in five minutes or less just do it now.
2. calendar the item if it will take more than 15 minutes, or if it is time sensitive. If something takes more than 15 minutes, even if it doesn't have a deadline, and even if it's of minor importance, it must be budgeted in a calendar. 
    - **Why?** 
        + something that long isn't going to fit quickly into a busy day. We have to reserve some space in advance, or budget to get it done. Otherwise it will just get pushed off into the future over and over. 
        + if the step is time sensitive, you also need to put that in your calendar. 
    - Your calendar is a solid, firm commitment of how you're going to spend your time.

**In general, if you're processing properly, most everything will either be done now or end up on your calendar.** 

3. everything else belongs on the task reminder list. Everything else refers to steps that take between five and 15 minutes and aren't time sensitive. The task reminder list, is most effective when used for short, brief, and flexible actions. Typically the minority of the items you process will end up here. **If the calendar is solid the task reminder list is fluid.** Use the task reminder list to remind you of possible dates and times when you're going to take action steps. If you don't perform the task at that specific time you can snooze, or reschedule the reminder. 

### recurring appointment
Another tip for when will it be done is that you may find it helpful to group repetitive tasks. have a recurring appointment in the calendar. Grouping repetitive tasks can be an efficient way to get in the groove and accomplish many things of the same type efficiently.

### Leave buffer
Another rule of thumb, leave buffer space between appointments. In general leave at least 10 minutes of buffer space for every scheduled hour. So if you have a two hour appointment, that means you're going to need to leave 20 minutes of buffer space after the appointment. Leaving buffer space will leave enough room for you to stay on top of unexpected interruptions and give you time to prepare for your next appointment. This helps with stress too.

## Where is its home
you need to decide where you're going to put this physical or digital item you've been processing, and possibly where you need to be to perform the next step. 


In the next video, we'll discuss how and where to file. In this video, I want to cover some helpful rules of thumb. 

### In summary
when you're answering the "Where is its home" processing question
* "Everything has a home, and no visitors allowed." 
* With physical items, "When it doubt, throw it out." With digital items, "When in doubt, keep it."
* Keep all contacts in one central location
* Categorize all your task and calendar items if that helps you be more efficient

In the end, we want to be able to put things away quickly, and find them just as quickly.

### Rule of thums
1. remember this phrase. "Everything has a home, and no visitors allowed." 
    - This means that items of similar type should be grouped together, and kept separate from everything else. This makes it much more efficient and easy to find things and put things away in the future.
    - What kind of home should you use? Well, you can use things like folders, boxes, trays, shelves. The tool you use can be flexible, as long as you create clear boundaries between different items, and don't mix them together.
2. what if you think you need to throw the item out? **So when it comes to physical, "When in doubt, throw it out." When it comes to digital, "When in doubt, keep it."**
3. where you keep the information of all the contacts you have, such as phone numbers, emails, addresses, and so on The rule is **to keep them all in one place that you can access at any time** use a service that syncs the data continuously, and makes it easier to share with others.
4. One *optional* suggestion of the Where question of processing, includes categorizing tasks and calendar items.
    - Some people have found it helpful to categorize items in their calendar, and task reminder list.
    - This is especially useful if you work at multiple locations, or meet with a variety of individuals. This makes it easy to find them, depending on the context of where you are at the time.
    - You could also use a category for recurring meetings. For instance, if I have a regular meeting with Susan, every single week at 10 o'clock, if I put all the items I need to discuss with her in my task list under the category of "One to One Susan," then when I go to the meeting with Susan, I can pull open the list, and there they all are in one place. 

## Paper filing
how to simplify and speed up the process of basic paper filing. This is not quite relevant for me today. Copying this for future reference.

### Non-financial
First, when filing non-financial documents use a simple alphabetical system. Set up hanging file folders and label each file folder alphabetically. You can usually purchase hanging file folders in groups of 25. One short of the full alphabet. So if you find yourself a folder short combine the letters X and Y which brings you to a total of 25 file hanging folders. Whenever you have some new document that you need to file pull out a manila folder write on the manila folder what you're going to put in there and then put that piece of paper in the folder. Use a manila folder rather than putting items directly into the hanging file folder. This will make it easier to retrieve the items in the future. 

So let's take an example with this piece of paper. This is a poem that I really enjoy. This is an inspirational quote. I might want to copy this and share it in a meeting or just refer back to it. Where do I file this piece of paper? Well, I simply file it under the first letter that comes to mind. So if I think of P for poems then I pull out a manila folder write poems on it stick the poem in there and then put it under P for poems. Now perhaps Q might come to your mind for quotes so you put it under Q for quotes. What letter you choose doesn't really matter. And that's part of the simplicity of this system. Just write down the first thing that comes to mind stick the papers in and then put the manila folder into the hanging file folder. This system works very well for any miscellaneous type of document that you have. 

But what if we have a client? If it's just a few putting them in the main filing system is enough. But if you have many many clients then you may need a set of alphabetical files reserved for that category. Clients. Or vendors. Or any other category where you have large number of one particular type of file. Then, using the client example whenever you file a client folder away you put it in there according to alphabetical order. So for instance here is a document from the Explorer California Company. So I'll pull out a manila folder I already had created for them in my client files under E. I'll stick the document in that manila folder put it back and I'm done. 

### Financial documents
What about financial documents, though?
* If you work in a larger company there probably already is a well established accounting filing system. So just use what's in place.
* For an individual working out of a home office or a small business create a set of 12 file folders. One for each month of the year. Then whenever you receive a statement or receipt any financial document put it into the month in which it was dated. If there wasn't a date file it within the month you received it. This simple system works well for home-based businesses service professionals or just personal finance. To be safe you'll want to keep those records for at least seven years. So create a new set of 12 month folders for each new year. Using a simple system like this will make it fast as possible to file documents and simple to find them again when needed. Now let's discuss how to handle filing documents on your computer.


## Digital filing

when it comes to digital items, when in doubt, keep them. But you may be wondering how to organize it all.

Six fairly universal principles for digital organization regardless of the tool you use. This applies to **everything except e-mail**, which will be covered later separately. 

1. if you're using a computer that contains both **personal and work** files, create two main folders; personal and work. This initial separation will make it easier to store items and find them later.
2. create **broad categories** within these folders. For instance, under my Work folder; I have legal, marketing, financial, sales, speaking, and so on.
3. you may create one more layer of subfolders. There's no one right or wrong way to create these folders, just use folder names and subcategories that are meaningful to you.

To summarize the above: **have three layers of folders and no more**. First, personal versus work. Then, broad categories. Then, subcategories. I recommend you not go any deeper than this. Otherwise, you give yourself too much work trying to sort and organize things, which is really not necessary in today's age of ever more effective search engines.
4. Once you've created the basic structure, then you'll have one folder name that you'll include in every subfolder you create called **old**. This is where you move older versions of files that you no longer are actively using. This allows you to recover old information and archive it quickly to make space. For instance, when I create a new version of my slides for my focused business speech, you notice that I move the older version into the old folder. Now it's not lost but it's no longer cluttering up the main subfolder. 
5. **Name different versions of the same files with year, month, day.** This leads to the file naming itself. I recommend that to avoid confusion, you save each new version under a new name. The easiest way I found to do this is with the year, month, day convention. Sometimes shown as this. Not only does this make it easy to create a new file version and not worry about making sure I'm calling it by the right version number but it comes in handy when viewing files sorted alphanumerically because it brings the newest version to the top. Then, after creating the new version or when I see an older version, I can drag and drop it into the old folder.
6. One final tip, make sure all of your files have **automatic back-ups**. There are many ways to accomplish this and software and hardware tools become outdated frequently. I'll just say, find a tool that you're comfortable with, that creates off-site back-ups of your files without you having to think about it. That way, even if your computer is completely destroyed, all you have to do is re-sync with your tool and in a matter of a day or two, all of your files will return.
